# Infinite Resource Nodes for Dyson Sphere Program

**DSP Infinite Resource Nodes** is a mod for the Unity game Dyson Sphere Program developed by Youthcat Studio and published by Gamera Game.  The game is available on [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366540/Dyson_Sphere_Program/).

With this mod resource nodes will produce unlimited resources.  Works with all resource node types when mined with either the miner or by Icarus.  Tired of node resource running out, and having to move and rebalance your miners?  If so, this mod's for you.  With this mod resource node functionality will work more like [Satisfactory](https://www.satisfactorygame.com/).

This mod works with existing saves.  It is not necessary to generate a new world.

The number of resource nodes will remain unchanged.  The rate at which you can pull resources out of a node is still limited.  This mod does not and will not change these game features.
